if (True):

    print("This prints because the statement is true")  #This if statement checks if True is True (surprise, it is) and prints out whatever is inside the if
#### Note the 4 space indent

if (5 == 5):
    print("This will print")  #This statement asks if 5 is equal to 5 and prints the phrase inside if it's true

if (10 != 7):
    print("This will print too")  #This statement checks if 10 is not equal to 7 and prints the phrase inside if true

#OUTPUT-> This prints because the statement is true
#OUTPUT-> This will print
#OUTPUT-> This will print too

#Note: This all prints in one run, but since there are three seperate print statements, they all print on a new line
